    <h1>Cat</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        The <b>cat</b> (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species in the family
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae">Felidae</a> and
        is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from
        the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat,
        a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ran ges freely and avoids human
        contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
        their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
        various cat registries.

    <p>
        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species:
        it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and
        retractable claws adapted to killing small prey.
        Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
        Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,
        hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.
        A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary
        hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high
        in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small
        mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

        and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails.
        Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically weigh
        between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).</p>
